# P5-Sign-Language-Detection-Using-Python-and-LSTM-Models

In this project, I developed a sign language detection system by combining keypoint detection and sequence-based action recognition. Using MediaPipe for holistic keypoint extraction and TensorFlow with Keras for deep learning, I built a robust LSTM-based neural network capable of handling sequential data. This system decodes sign language gestures in real time by leveraging keypoint sequences detected from facial, hand, and body landmarks.

ðŸ”§ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python 3: For scripting and project development.
- NumPy: To handle numerical data manipulation.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing data and model performance.
- OpenCV: To capture video frames and enable real-time detection.
- MediaPipe: To detect holistic keypoints, including face, hands, and body.
- TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the LSTM-based deep learning model.

Project Goal:

To achieve real-time sign language detection using sequences of keypoints.

Key Steps:
1. Extract keypoints using MediaPipe Holistic.
2. Train a deep learning LSTM model to recognize patterns in sequences.
3. Implement real-time gesture detection and prediction using OpenCV.

How It Works:
1. Keypoint Collection: Extract holistic landmarks (face, hands, body) using MediaPipe Holistic and store the keypoints for each gesture.
2. Model Training: Train a sequential LSTM deep learning model capable of understanding temporal patterns in the keypoint sequences.
3. Real-Time Detection: Integrate the trained model with OpenCV to predict gestures in real time from live webcam input.

ðŸ“‹ Project Workflow
1. Install and Import Dependencies
Set up your Python environment and install essential libraries such as OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, TensorFlow, and Matplotlib.
2. Detect Keypoints with MediaPipe Holistic
Use MediaPipe Holistic to extract key landmarks for the face, hands, and body. These keypoints form the foundation of gesture recognition.
3. Extract and Format Keypoint Data
Convert the detected keypoints into structured numerical data (e.g., x, y, z coordinates) for training the model.
4. Organize Folders for Data Collection
Create directories to organize collected data by class (e.g., different sign language gestures).
5. Collect Keypoint Data for Training and Testing
Record keypoint data for each gesture, ensuring balanced datasets for both training and testing.
6. Preprocess Data and Generate Labels and Features
Normalize keypoint values, create one-hot-encoded labels, and split the data into training and testing sets.
7. Design and Train the LSTM Neural Network
Build a sequential LSTM model to learn temporal patterns in gesture sequences and train it on the processed dataset.
8. Make Predictions on New Data
Test the trained model by predicting gestures from new input data and evaluating its performance.
9. Save Model Weights
Save the trained model's weights for future use to avoid retraining from scratch.
10. Evaluate Model Performance
Use metrics such as accuracy and a confusion matrix to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance on the testing data.
11. Test in Real-Time Applications
Integrate the trained model with a live webcam feed to detect and predict gestures in real-time.
